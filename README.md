Hi there,

Welcome to Green Eye: Automated Litterbug Tracker.
The following libraries will be implemented and learned from scratch:
For the Whole Project:
OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
YOLOv4: For real-time object detection.
DeepSORT: For object tracking.
Face Recognition: For identifying faces.
FastAPI: For developing the backend API.
SQLAlchemy: For database interactions.
Pandas: For data handling and logging.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization (optional, for analytics and reporting).

This is a collaborative project between myself (@davidojekunle) and my partner (@timiilo). The project is split into two parts to allow us to handle different tasks, thereby speeding up the development process and improving efficiency. The project duration for the BETA version is approximately 1 month, while the full-blown project is expected to be completed within 2 months after the BETA release.

I will be posting updates after each commit to track our progress. Thank you for following along!

Best regards,
Davidojekunle , Timilehinilo
